    content: Until a few months ago I had NEVER been to a chiropractor. From the front
      desk to the doctor and all other office staff they are awesome. They listen
      to me and help me with anything they can. My back feels so much better. I am
      so glad I walked in the day I did.

    content: 'I have been very pleased with the adjustments and care I have received
      at Lake Martin Chiropractic. At my first visit in November, my back and neck
      were x rayed, then I discussed my medical history and a plan of care was made.
      I went 2 days a week for adjustments and E STEM for a short time and now once
      a month. Dr Peaden is awesome and I feel very confident in his skills.'

    content: Dr. Peaden and his staff worked me in without an appointment this morning.
      He found the cause of my pain, recommended a treatment plan, and tailored it
      to my crazy schedule. Couldn’t ask for a more friendly atmosphere.
