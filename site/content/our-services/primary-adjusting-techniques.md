Activator/Impulse is one of the most widely researched chiropractic techniques with clinical trials to support its efficacy. It uses a small, hand-held instrument called the Activator or impulse adjustor to deliver a gentle impulse force to the spine with the goal of restoring motion to the targeted spinal vertebra or joint. It is an alternative to the traditional manual form of spinal manipulation.

Diversified (Full Spine Adjusting): Diversified Technique is the most widely used and accepted chiropractic manipulative technique. It is the primary technique taught at Chiropractic schools across the country. Diversified technique is characterized by a very precise high velocity, low amplitude manual thrust. Its objective is to restore proper movement and alignment to the spine. It is a highly useful technique to restore joint function.
