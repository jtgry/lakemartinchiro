      Jennifer Shows is a Chiropractic Assistant with Lake Martin Chiropractic Health Center. She lives in her hometown of Eclectic with her husband Chris Shows. She graduated from Elmore County High School in 2007. In her free time, Jennifer loves being with her family and friends, especially her two nieces. She loves being adventurous, taking trips to the beach, traveling, and spending her summers on Lake Martin.

       A fun fact about Jennifer is that she loves anything with a pineapple print on it. She was welcomed in the Lake Martin Chiropractic Health family in October of 2017 and truly loves her work family and patients. â€œMy favorite part about chiropractic care, aside from the great benefits, is helping our patients feel their best.
