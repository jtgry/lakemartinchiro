content = "If you are in pain when you come into our office, the first goal is to reduce your symptoms to help you feel better. This may include: ice or heat application instructions, certain activities or positions to avoid, and at home exercises and/or stretches. Depending on the severity of your problem, the doctor will suggest a corrective care program. It is typical to need care 2-3 times per week for 4-12 weeks.  \nMost people are under the assumption that if they don't feel any pain that there is nothing wrong with them - that they are healthy. Unfortunately, pain is a very poor indicator of health. In fact, pain and other symptoms frequently only appear after a disease or other condition has become advanced.\n"
