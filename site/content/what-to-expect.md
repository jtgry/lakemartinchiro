content = "If you are in pain when you come into our office, the first goal is to reduce your symptoms to help you feel better. This may include: ice or heat application instructions, certain activities or positions to avoid, and at home exercises and/or stretches. Depending on the severity of your problem, the doctor will suggest a corrective care program. It is typical to need care 2-3 times per week for 4-12 weeks.  \nMost people are under the assumption that if they don't feel any pain that there is nothing wrong with them - that they are healthy. Unfortunately, pain is a very poor indicator of health. In fact, pain and other symptoms frequently only appear after a disease or other condition has become advanced.\n"

content = "During the corrective care phase, muscles and other tissues are allowed to heal more completely, thereby helping prevent injury. Correcting your spine & posture is crucial to reduce chances of having serious issues in the future. During the correction / restorative phase of your care, you will not have to receive adjustments as often as you did during the first phase of care and, depending on your particular circumstances, you may begin doing exercises and stretches either in office or at home to help accelerate your healing. In order to prevent a rapid recurrence of symptoms, it is necessary to continue receiving care even though your symptoms are gone.\nDo not be discouraged if you have mild flare-ups in your symptoms on occasion. This is normal. Flare-ups are bound to occur during this phase because your body has not fully healed. Depending on the severity of your injury or condition and how long you have been suffering from it, this phase of your care may last anywhere from a few months to a couple of years\nWe will verify your insurance coverage and explain how it might support your chiropractic needs. Our wellness team will work with you to create healthy habits and routines for your lifestyle. Every person is unique; therefore, everyone requires a customized wellness plan. The purpose of our wellness program is for you to achieve good spinal alignment, have a healthy diet, exercise, and maintain a positive mental state. It is typical to need care 4-8 times per month for 6-24 months, depending on your overall health and the severity of your problem"
