  heading: What To Expect
  content: "If you are in pain when you come into our office, the first goal is to
    reduce your symptoms to help you feel better. This may include: ice or heat application
    instructions, certain activities or positions to avoid, and at home exercises
    and/or stretches. Depending on the severity of your problem, the doctor will suggest
    a corrective care program. It is typical to need care 2-3 times per week for 4-12
    weeks.  \n\nMost people are under the assumption that if they don’t feel any pain
    that there is nothing wrong with them - that they are healthy. Unfortunately,
    pain is a very poor indicator of health. In fact, pain and other symptoms frequently
    only appear after a disease or other condition has become advanced."

    Upon entering our office, our trained staffed will welcome you as a member of our family.  We will request that you complete our patient forms. This paperwork provides us with your health history and information on your condition.

    Next, you will have a one-on-one consultation with Dr. Peaden to discuss your spinal health-related problems, concerns, and potential treatment options. This initial visit is designed for Dr. Peaden , to learn more about you, your condition( back pain, neck pain, headaches) , and  expectations to determine chiropractic care can meet your goals. It also is a time for you as a patient to determine if this is the right chiropractic office for you. Correcting your spine is a team effort. Once your body has fully healed, routine chiropractic care can help ensure that your physical problems do not return and keep your body in optimal condition. Just like continuing an exercise program and eating well in order to sustain the benefits of exercise and proper diet, it is necessary to continue chiropractic care to ensure the health of your musculoskeletal system.

    When you make routine chiropractic care a part of your lifestyle, you avoid many of the aches and pains that so many people suffer through, your joints will last longer, and you will be able to engage in more of the activities you love.

  heading: Examination and X-ray Studies
  content: "After your consultation, Dr. Peaden, will perform a complete chiropractic
    examination testing your reflexes and flexibility. This exam includes a special
    computerized nerve and muscle scan. This simple but effective test will tell **Dr.
    Peaden** if your **neck pain** or **back pain** is a **musculoskeletal** issue
    or not. Other standard neurological, orthopedic, postural, and physical tests
    will be performed as well. We explain our procedures in detail, answer your questions
    and get your consent before each procedure.\n\nDepending on your specific condition,
    we will take any necessary X-rays as part of your spine examination.  X-rays help
    us develop the most effective treatment plan for you, and alert us of any serious
    spinal conditions. Most people are amazed once they see their X-rays up close.
    In some cases, they can even identify their misalignments and degeneration themselves.
    At the specific periods during the corrective care we do follow up x-rays to confirm
    the **spinal correction**    "

    Once the information is collected and examinations are performed, Dr. Peaden will give you a detailed report of all findings and answer any questions including: 

    1\.     How can you help me?

    2\.     How often do I need to come in?

    3\.     What will my treatment cost?

    After reviewing your health history, goals, and examining your spine and X-rays, Dr. Peaden will discuss recommendations and notify you if your condition requires care with other providers.   Dr. Peaden will provide the best treatment and wellness program for your needs.

    At the conclusion of this initial appointment, you can choose to experience your first treatment. This may include spinal adjustments, physical therapy, and/or soft tissue massage.  Treatment is interactive, so you can express concerns about the different styles of treatment anytime.

    Prior to leaving, the doctor will suggest a wellness program to incorporate outside of treatment.  If you are in pain when you first come into our office this may include: ice or heat application instructions, certain activities or positions to avoid, and at home exercises and/or stretches.  If you desire, our wellness team will work with you also to create healthy habits and routines for your lifestyle.  Every person is unique; therefore, everyone requires a customized wellness plan.  The purpose of our wellness program is for you to achieve good spinal alignment, have a healthy diet, exercise, and maintain a positive mental state.
