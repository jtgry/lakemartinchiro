  heading: What To Expect
  content: "If you are in pain when you come into our office, the first goal is to
    reduce your symptoms to help you feel better. This may include: ice or heat application
    instructions, certain activities or positions to avoid, and at home exercises
    and/or stretches. Depending on the severity of your problem, the doctor will suggest
    a corrective care program. It is typical to need care 2-3 times per week for 4-12
    weeks.  \n\nMost people are under the assumption that if they donâ€™t feel any pain
    that there is nothing wrong with them - that they are healthy. Unfortunately,
    pain is a very poor indicator of health. In fact, pain and other symptoms frequently
    only appear after a disease or other condition has become advanced."
