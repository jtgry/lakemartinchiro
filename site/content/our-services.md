    the finest chiropractic care for our patients. Dr. Peaden offers gentle and effective
    chiropractic treatments that will help you get out of pain and will restore and
    rehabilitate your spine to further your overall health and wellness. We use a
    hands-on approach as well as precision instruments for gentle and precise chiropractic
    adjustments along with additional therapies. We emphasize corrective care to make
    your adjustments hold as long as possible to minimize your need and dependence
    on future treatments. We work to retrain the Upper Cervical so that the body will
    start to regain the ability to align itself. Our advanced combinations of techniques
    work synergistically to make adjustments hold as long as possible thus allowing
    overall wellness to be achieved.  If you have any questions, please call us at (334)
