    content: 'Depending on your specific condition, we will take any necessary X-rays
      as part of your spine examination. X-rays help us develop the most effective
      treatment plan for you, and alert us of any serious spinal conditions. Most
      people are amazed once they see their X-rays up close. In some cases, they can
      even identify their misalignments and degeneration themselves. At the specific
      periods during the corrective care we do follow up x-rays to confirm the spinal
      correction.
